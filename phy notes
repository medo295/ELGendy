=> Frequency still const if same material
=> Amplitude do not effect on Time Period
=> Fundmental Frequency = F(n)-F(n-1) || F(n) / n
=> Distance between crest and trought = 1/2 Wave Length  || 1/2 Period
=> Distacne between Two sucussive crest OR Two sucussive trough = Wave Length
=> Time Period = whole time / no of crest || no of trought
